The following is a list of known problems
which have not been resolved yet.

1.	Implementation of a suffix tree construction over a sliding
	window (stsw) has broken character conversion
	routine when reading an input file.
	It results in SIGSEGV signal when in function iconv.
	This problem can be experienced after iconv experiences
	E2BIG error. Then its subsequent call fails.
	This occurs only when compiled with support
	for wide characters, because E2BIG error cannot
	error with standard, 1 byte characters.

2.	Slowscan is implemented so that it always starts from explicit vertex.
	It would be desirable to adjust it so that it could start
	the comparison from an arbitrary edge character.
	This would probably decrease the time complexity
	on some input files dramatically.

3.	There is no option to set the preferred size of internal tables.
	It would be nice to at least be able to set the initial size
	of the table tbranch and the hash table tedge in order to
	avoid possible reallocations and rehashing.
