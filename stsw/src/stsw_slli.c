 * A function to prolong all the suffixes in the intermediate suffix tree

 *
 * @param
 * variation	the desired algorithm variation to use
 * @param
 * starting_position	The position in the sliding window of the first
 * 			character of the first suffix to be prolonged.
 * 			Note that despite we are prolonging all the suffixes
 * 			currently present in the suffix tree, we don't have to
 * 			prolong all of them explicitly. The starting_position
 * 			should point to the beginning of the longest suffix,
 * 			which we might have to prolong explicitly.
 * @param
 * ending_position	the position in the sliding window of the character
 * 			just after the last character of the suffixes
 * 			after being prolonged
 * @param
 * active_index		The position in the sliding window from which we start
 * 			to prolong the first suffix.
 * 			The text starting at this position will be matched
 * 			against the edges leading from the current active_node.
 * @param
 * active_node	The node from which the prolonging actively starts.
 * 		Actually this is either the active point or the closest parent
 * 		of the active point. After the function returns,
 * 		it is set to the next active point.
 * 		The active point is the position in the suffix tree,
 * 		which corresponds to the last character
 * 		of the longest substring, which occurs only as a suffix
 * 		in the current suffix tree and does not end
 * 		at the leaf node. FIXME: Is this correct?
 * @param
 * tfsw		the actual sliding window containing the text
 * 		currently used by the suffix tree
 * @param
 * stsw		the actual suffix tree
 *
