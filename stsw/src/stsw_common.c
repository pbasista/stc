 * Also, this function does not update the total number of blocks,

 * 			number of characters read from the input file

 * 		read from the input file in this function call.
 * 		Note that this variable contains the number of bytes read,
 * 		which does not necessarily have to be the same
 * 		as the number of bytes read and converted.
 * 		For example, when there are no bytes left in the output buffer,
 * 		but there are still some bytes left in the input (conversion)
 * 		buffer, it means that not all of the bytes
 * 		which have already been read have also already been used
 * 		for the conversion to the characters. These read but
 * 		yet unused bytes will be utilized later,
 * 		in the next call of this function.
 * @param
 * tfsw		the sliding window which will be updated
 * 		with the new characters coming
 * 		from the previously specified input file
 *
 * @return	If the reading was successful, this function returns 0.
 * 		If the reading was partially successful (it had to stop,
 * 		because the input file does not have enough
 * 		unread bytes left), (-1) is returned.
 * 		Otherwise, a positive error number is returned.
