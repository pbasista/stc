Suffix tree construction (stc)
==============================

Implementation and benchmark of some basic algorithms
for the construction of the suffix tree over the text
coming from the input file.

This application provides two executables:
st	to create the suffix tree entirely in memory
	for the whole input text
stsw	to create the suffix tree for just a constant-sized
	portion of the input text (the sliding window)
	and maintain it while the sliding window is shifted
	along the whole input text.

Requirements:
-------------

For compiling:

C compiler at least partially conforming to the C99 standard, because of:
	- the type unsigned long long
	- "%zu" printf format length specifier for size_t

and also at least partially conforming to the POSIX.1-2001 standard,
because of:
	- function random and related stuff
	- function iconv and related stuff
	- function getopt and related stuff

=== Optional compiling requirements ===

C compiler at least partially conforming to the POSIX.1c standard,
because of the usage of POSIX threads (pthread.h).



For building the documentation:

Any non-ancient version of doxygen.

Compilation:
------------

It should be as easy as:

make

To build the documentation, simply execute:

doxygen

or

make doc

Usage:
------

Run the compiled executables without any parameters
and follow the provided instructions.

Generated documentation in HTML format will be placed in
doc/html subdirectory. Navigate your web browser
to index.html to start using it.
